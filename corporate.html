      <h2 class="textcolor">Marketing</h2>
      <h4 class="textcolor mt-4">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
      <p class="textcolor">Explain the context of the campaign is (What the campaign is about, what the message is, which promotional activities were executed). In addition, present the objectives as mentioned in the Communication & Media Plan.</p>
      <p class="textcolor">Explain and justify the chosen channels/platforms used and show there is a solid connection to the objectives established in the Communication & Media Plan.</p>
      <h4 class="textcolor mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
      <p class="textcolor">During the social media campaign, we have learned that being consistent is extremely important. We post on every Tuesday and Friday, so our followers expect us to post on those days. Furthermore, we have realized that the time we post on Instagram is the most crucial factor. We have noticed that we receive fewer likes when we post at 15.00 than when we post at 20.00.</p>
      <p class="textcolor">Our stories on Instagram did not get viewed as much as expected. We figured posting stories was a good way to be consistent with our followers, but it turned out that this was not the case. However, our reels got viewed much more than we expected. The first reels that we posted received over 6.000 views, so we believe that it got a lot of attention on the Instagram explorer page.</p>
      <p class="textcolor">Something that we would do differently is definitely to strive to keep our color scheme as consistent as possible. Although we have used our color palette in the posts, the “feed” did not turn out the way we hoped it to look. We believe that using the same colors on your social media page helps to maintain consistency.</p>
     <p class="textcolor">Overall, we are pleased with the positive responses we have received from our interviewees. Many people were interested in the topic “cultural inequality” and liked the design of our hoodies. We have learned to step out of our comfort zones and speak up for something we stand for, in our case, cultural equality. We have discovered the importance of being consistent and to really think about your target audience. We believe that the most important lesson we have learned is that just because we might not like something, it does not mean that others will not like it either. We have learned to create content specifically for our target audience rather than content that appeals to us.</p>
</p>
      <h4 class="textcolor mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
      <p class="textcolor">Reflection on what has been done and describe in detail what you would do if the project would continue.</p>
      <p class="textcolor">Describe in detail your future recommendations if the campaign would be continued.</p>
      <p class="textcolor">Detail and describe clearly the process of what your would do differently based on you experience on this project related to the marketing assignment.</p>
      <h4 class="textcolor mt-4">Professionalism</h4>
      <p class="textcolor">Present and organize below all social media/online activities of the campaign. Context and material are according to the brand style, image, and vision. Images on the site are of high-quality, readable, and properly designed.</p>
